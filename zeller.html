<h1>Ryan Zeller</h1>
<p>Born and raised in Topeka. Proud to say, I got out and survived unscathed. Grew up to be a well-rounded individual. Over the years, I’ve gotten involved in many different charities. Giving back to the community is important to me. I work in the oh-so interesting telecommunications field. I also love to travel when I can. Lastly, I’m really good at technobabble, analytics. being considerate, and carbo-loading.</p>
